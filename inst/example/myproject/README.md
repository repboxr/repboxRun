This is an example project for the repbox toolchain.

You can try to run the analysis by adapting and running the `run_repbox.R` script.

If you want to run a repbox analysis for another article and reproduction package, best use the function `repbox_init_project` in the package `repboxRun` to initialize a project folder.
